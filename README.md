# Do not Use

This is just for my personal lab. It probably won't work in your lab without a lot of hacking.


## Set up

You need to export the following before running these playbooks

```
export OVIRT_PASSWORD="ovirtpassword"
export OREG_AUTH_USER="userforregistry"
export OREG_AUTH_PASSWORD="passwordforregistry"
```

For the POC installer you'll need an additional settings

```
export IPA_PASSWORD="myipapassword"
export POOL_ID="mypoolid"
```
